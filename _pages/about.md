Welcome to my digital space! I am thrilled to share a bit about my journey and passions with you. Currently, I find my professional home at the Warshel Center for Multiscale Simulations at the University of Southern California (USC), where I embrace the challenges and excitement of being a Postdoctoral Research Associate. My research adventure is a thrilling ride at the crossroads of physics, chemistry, and biology. I delve deep into the intricacies of the Renilla Luciferase, a fascinating enzyme also known as Nature’s neon light, using the intricate QM/MM methods. My goal? To unravel the mysteries of its bioluminescence properties and understand the complex mechanisms behind its glow. But my curiosity doesn't stop there. I am on a quest to comprehend the catalysis of amyloid fibrils, a protein linked to the debilitating conditions of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It’s a challenge I take on with enthusiasm, knowing that this work could contribute to the broader understanding of these diseases.

My journey in science began long before my current role. I am a proud alumnus of Ben-Gurion University in Israel, where I honed my skills and indulged my fascination with the world of computational physical organic chemistry, graduating in 2021. During my time there, I was captivated by the enigmatic role of Quantum tunneling, nature’s very own spooky action, in Organic Reactions. The pursuit of knowledge led me to the prestigious Weizmann Institute of Science, where I was honored to be a Dean’s Excellence Postdoctoral Fellow from 2021 to 2022. There, I continued my exploration into the tunneling phenomena in inorganic systems and NHC organocatalytic systems, all with the aim of designing more efficient catalysts.
