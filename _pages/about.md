Welcome to my digital space! I'm excited to pull back the curtain and give you a glimpse into my life as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at USC's Warshel Center for Multiscale Simulations. Picture a rollercoaster ride through the realms of physics, chemistry, and biology—that's my daily grind! I’m currently on a mission to decode the Renilla Luciferase enzyme, Nature’s very own neon light, with the help of advanced QM/MM methods.

But wait, there's more! My scientific curiosity extends to unraveling the secrets of amyloid fibrils, proteins with links to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It’s a high-stakes challenge, but I’m all in, fueled by the promise of breakthroughs and deeper insights.

Flashback to my roots: I'm a product of Ben-Gurion University in Israel, where I plunged headfirst into the fascinating world of computational physical organic chemistry, graduating in 2021. My love affair with science took me to the prestigious Weizmann Institute of Science, where, as a Dean’s Excellence Postdoctoral Fellow, I continued my deep dive into the world of Quantum tunneling and Organocatalysis.

Thank you for stopping by, and I'm eager to share my scientific journey and discoveries with you!
